									<p> 
									When President Rodrigo Duterte took place in June 2016, he immediately 
									implemented the War on Drugs campaign. The campaign aimed to address the 
									country’s increasing drug problem. President Duterte even made a bold statement, 
									promising to eradicate the drug problem in the country within 6 months. The 
									campaign was done through “Oplan Tokhang”, where police personnel does a house-to-house raid to subdue possible suspects. 
									This action of the Duterte Administration quickly received a lot of controversies,</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p> not just within the country, but all around the world. 
									Throughout the process of clearing drug syndicates in the country, thousands of Filipinos were 
									killed in police operations by either being targeted or caught in cross-fires. Victims of such killings accused the government of extrajudicial killings because even 
									innocent people were affected by these police operations. Some critics have argued the ineffectiveness of the campaign because only small-time 
									pushers were captured, leaving the wealthier ones with less consequence.</p>

						<h2>Statistical Overview of the Fatalities of the War on Drugs’</h2>
					  </header>
					  <span class="image" >
						<img src="images/pic03.png" alt="" />
					  </span>
							<p>
								Through the early years of the War on Drugs, Metro Manila received the most beatings 
								from the Oplan Tokhang, receiving approximately 42% fatality rate. This is because most 
								of the circulation of drugs happens within these areas. Included in these fatalities are the 
								thousands of people who died during the campaign. Eventually, around 2018 the focus of 
								the Philippine National Police shifted to Central Luzon, specifically to Bulacan and Nueva 
								Ecija, which is relatively close to the NCR. Although the reason for this shift of focus of the 
								government is unclear, Central Luzon became the “killing den” of the Oplan Tokhang 
								having a rising fatality rate of around 18%. Before the end of the Duterte Administration, it 
								was evident that the fatality rate of Nueva Ecija rose to around 13% surpassing both NCR 
								and Bulacan at that time. These data only consist of places around Central Luzon which 
								heavily implies that these were the areas where a lot of people inhumanly lost their lives 
								through abusive governance. These numbers represent how many families are broken 
								and the communities left in fear. It shows how this campaign is full of flaws, where it 
								caused more societal problems rather than solving an existing one.

							<h2>The Tragic Death of Kian delos Santos</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Kian delos Santos, a 17-year-old boy from Caloocan City, was brutally murdered 
							by three police officers in August 2017. Even though the police officers who 
							murdered Kian were imprisoned, the 
							Philippine National Police claimed that Kian 
							had fired at the police first causing them to 
							fire back. This claim was soon debunked by 
							footage of the police dragging Kian into a 
							dark alley and brutally shooting him. Kian 
							was only one of many innocent people 
							killed during the campaign for the War on 
							Drugs. His tragic death enraged thousands 
							of Filipinos and his family questioning 
							Duterte’s brutal governance. This sparks 
							protests and rallies demanding justice for 
							Kian’s death and the end of extrajudicial 
							killings. The Philippine government 
							received criticism throughout social media and the whole world, marking a crucial 
							moment against the violence of the War on Drugs.

							<h2>How Does Art Function as a Tool for Protest in the War on Drugs?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Throughout the time of the War on 
							Drugs, people have protested about 
							how the system of the campaign is full 
							of flaws and how it violated so many 
							human rights of a normal citizen. 
							Through this protest, people have 
							done many art-related ways to protest 
							against the government such as 
							posters, murals, and even music. Two 
							hip-hop artists in the Philippines, 
							BLKD and Callix, released a song 
							entitled “Kolateral: Buelo” in 2019, 
							exposing Duterte’s bureaucracy on 
							War on Drugs. The album “Kolateral” 
							focuses on the memoranda and the 
							mission orders to expose the 
							organizations or people who had followed these chaotic decrees. Art can become 
							a voice for all of the victims of this violent war, turning their pain and anger into a 
							powerful expression of protest against the abusive government. BLKD and Callix 
							showcased this idea, using their talent to expose the harsh truth behind the 
							Duterte Administration.

						<h3>Environmental Advocacy</h3>
						<p>A group called Atelier Aquatic is an organization that teaches people 
							about the importance of aquatic nature. In 2019, Atelier Aquatic went to 
							Port Barton, Palawan to conduct its operations about the importance of 
							marine life in Palawan, specifically sea turtles. One of their key projects in 
							the area is “Art on Barton”, where they painted multiple huge murals to 
							promote sea turtle conservation. By doing so, Atelier Aquatic showed how 
							art can be a way to conserve a population of an endangered species.

						<h3>Cultural Preservation</h3>
						<p>Apo Wang-Od, the oldest living mambabatok, has become a symbol of 
							the Kalinga signature tattoo art. Living in the remote mountains of 
							Buscalan, locals and tourists from all around the world are eager to have 
							a tattoo from her. With over a hundred years of experience, she is an icon 
							of the Kalinga culture that ensures the continuity of their craft. She knows 
							that for pangbabatok to continue, she needs younger companions to train 
							to continue what their ancestors have started. The public community has 
							helped the Kalinga tribe to preserve their culture as well, the use of 
							documentaries and social media has put the culture of pagbabatok back 
							on the map. Wang-Od and her colleagues were also invited to multiple 
							exhibitions to showcase their culture to larger audiences. By doing so, the 
							art of pangbabatok will continue to preserve this culture that has been 
							going on for hundreds of years.
