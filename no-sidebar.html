										<h4>Rogue PNP</h4>
										<p>The scary-looking figure labeled “Rogue PNP” depicts the Philippine National Police’s abuse of power and corruption during the drug war. Appearance shows a predatory look that reflects the campaign’s violent nature.</p>

									</div>
							
									<div class="hotspot-wrapper" style="top:26%; left:68%;">
									<div class="hotspot"></div>

										<h4>Axe</h4>
										<p>The axe labeled “Oplan Tokhang” and “Tokhang for RANSOM” depicts the drug war’s violent procedure, emphasizing how the campaign became a mechanism for oppression rather than justice.</p>

									<div class="hotspot-wrapper" style="top:33%; left:15%;">
										<div class="hotspot"></div>
										<div class="info-panel">
											<h4>Scope</h4>
											<p>The scope, labeled “Execution” and “Extortion,” depicts how the campaign looks for victims where it can gain profit, hence corruption.</p>

											<h4>Trailing skulls</h4>
											<p>The skulls trailing the main figure portray what is the campaign doing to the victims, leaving them dead, which is the result of EJK</p>
									</div>
									</div>
									<p>The overall message of the poster exposes the underlying misuse of the power of the authority of the drug war campaign, turning it into a symbol of terror. The artwork is a critique of the dehumanizing and violent nature of the drug war and the brutal methods employed by law enforcement under this campaign. The trail of skulls define the campaign, emphasizing its inhumanity and the widespread harm inflicted on marginalized communities.</p>

									<h4 style="text-align: center"> New York Times' interpretation of Duterte’s ‘War on Drugs’ </h4>
									<img src="images/art12.jpg" alt="Protest Art" class="image fit" style="width:100%; height:auto;" />
									<p>At a glance, the editorial cartoon mimics William Tell's heroic feat of archery. However, in the artwork, Rodrigo Duterte is holding a bazooka instead of a bow and arrow, aiming it at a worm-infested apple on top of the head of a man representing the Philippines.
										This cartoon shows that the Philippines is subject to harm whether the apple is hit or not. In contrast to the War on Drugs, the collateral damage from the campaign is indeed at an alarming level as innocent citizens die without due process.

									<h2>Common Art Symbols Related to the War on Drugs</h2>
									<p>The War on Drugs has elicited the creation of artworks to convey the experienced trauma, violence, and loss by its victims. The following symbols are found to encapture the brutality, fear, and costs of the government's controversial campaign.</p>
								</header>

								<div id="gallery" class="grid-container" >
									<div class="grid" style="grid-template-columns: auto auto auto">
										<div class="grid-item">
											<h3>Skulls and Corpses</h3>
											<img src="images/art4.jpg" alt="Art Piece 4" title="by Rene Aranda from The Philippine Star">
											<p>These emphasize the human cost of the War on Drugs, highlighting the high number of drug-related deaths that have occurred without due process or legal accountability.
												Victims of the drug war are often depicted as lifeless bodies, sometimes lying in the streets, to capture the violence and dehumanization caused by these killings.
												</p>
										</div>
										<div class="grid-item">
											<h3>Blood & the Color Red</h3>
											<img src="images/art5.png" alt="Art Piece 5" title="by Sean Anthony Penn Lacorte from Atenews">
											<p>Blood represents both violence and injustice. It shows the reality of the killings brought about by the War on Drugs, the bloodshed on the streets.
												Red is often used in paint, splatters, or drips that symbolize the violence associated with the blood spilled from bodies or smeared across images of the war's victims, highlighting the brutality.
												</p>
										</div>
										<div class="grid-item">
											<h3>Guns and Bullet Holes</h3>
											<img src="images/art6.jpg" alt="Art Piece 6" title="War against drugs back in business by Arlene Pasaje from Edge Davao">
											<p>These represent the violence and rapid escalation of the War on Drugs. The use of firearms is common in depictions of the war.
												These works often depict victims with gunshot wounds to the head or chest, or focus on firearms to directly associate the killings with state-sanctioned or extrajudicial violence.
												</p>
										</div>
										<div class="grid-item">
											<h3>Mothers and Children</h3>
											<img src="images/art7.jpeg" alt="Art Piece 7" title="War on Drugs by Rene Elevera">
											<p>They are often depicted to emphasize the impact of the killings on families. These figures evoke the innocence, grief, and loss associated with the war; they are used to humanize the victims.
												They depict a powerful image used to show the emotional devastation caused by the killings and the human cost of the campaign.
												</p>
										</div>
										<div class="grid-item">
											<h3>Cloth Covers</h3>
											<img src="images/art8.jpg" alt="Art Piece 8" title="by Neil Doloricon for Malaya Business Insight">
											<p>The depiction of victims with cloth covering them depicts the anonymity and erasure of their identity. Many of the war's victims are marginalized individuals or the poor, whose deaths are often overlooked.
												The covers emphasize how these victims are often treated as nameless statistics rather than human beings with their own lives, families, and stories.
												</p>
										</div>
										<div class="grid-item">
											<h3>Surveillance</h3>
											<img src="images/art9.jpg" alt="Art Piece 9" title="by Rene Aranda from The Philippine Star">
											<p>This is used to symbolize state control, monitoring, and the loss of privacy in the drug war. The campaign has involved both state surveillance and the fear of being targeted by authorities, which creates an atmosphere of fear and paranoia.
												This suggests the omnipresence of state power under the drug war. It can also symbolize how the state views its citizens as either criminals or potential criminals.
												</p>
										</div>
										<div class="grid-item">
											<h3>Protest & Resistance Imagery</h3>
											<img src="images/art10.jpg" alt="Art Piece 10" title="People's fury against Duterte by Ang Bayan from PRWC">
											<p>The depictions of raised fists, banners, and crowds in protest serve as symbols of resistance, defiance, and the fight for justice in the War on Drugs. These symbols are used in artworks calling for an end to the violence and for justice for the victims of the war.
												Protesters holding signs that call for justice, or groups raising their fists, are often shown in artworks as part of the broader resistance against the drug war's violence. They symbolize hope, unity, and the demand for accountability from the government.
												</p>
										</div>
										<div class="grid-item">
											<h3>Scales of Justice</h3>
											<img src="images/art11.jpg" alt="Art Piece 11" title="by Eugene Bacasmas from The Philippine Star">
											<p>The scales of justice are a classic symbol of fairness and the rule of law. When tilted, the scales represent corruption, the failure of the legal system, and the perversion of justice. This is a common symbol in artworks about the War on Drugs, as it critiques the lack of accountability for those responsible for the killings.
												An unbalanced set of scales may suggest that the justice system is no longer serving its function, emphasizing the gap between the ideal of justice and the reality of lawlessness brought by the campaign.
