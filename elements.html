								<h3><b><strong>Use of Art in Addressing Social and Political Issues</strong></b></h3>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
								<p>Historically, art has played a significant role in addressing social and 
									political injustices, even when not made for protest. Particularly in the 
									Philippines, it has been used as an expression of resistance for the 
									marginalized; such as in the case of protest art during the era of martial 
									law, with which came the emergence of the social realist movement to 
									oppose the Marcos dictatorship. With this, artists created a unique 
									expression of art, deviating from Western aesthetics to explore 
									indigenous and folk art. In the modern day, artists have used their work to 
									challenge injustices and raise social awareness; in particular, addressing 
									extrajudicial killings during Duterte’s “war on drugs” campaign. An 
									example of this would be Resbak! Arts and Resistance to the Drug 
									Killings, an art exhibition that features works of visual art and 
									photography, highlighting the effects of the campaign especially on the 
									vulnerable population.

								<h4>➢ To Provoke Thought and Elicit Emotion</h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>The ability of art to provoke emotion may be best illustrated in protest art. 
									To effectively address the social and political issues being conveyed to its 
									audience, protest art can be made to use visceral imagery or symbolism 
									to create a strong emotional impact. Carlo Gabuco’s art installation Those 
									Without Names is just one example, creating a deep and immersive 
									experience, to evoke a shocking response among viewers. In this case, 
									Gabuco used actual objects, recordings, and hundreds of photographs 
									with the intent to elicit such reactions. With artworks such as these, the 
									effects of the campaign, particularly the extrajudicial killings, are made 
									more personal to the audience, leading to more awareness of the issues 
									that exist as a result.</p>
								<h4>➢ Social Media</h4>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>Social media is a powerful tool in further amplifying the impact of protest 
									art. By exposing more people to such works, and therefore widening the 
									audience to engage in and discuss these works, more opportunities are 
									created for a potential public consciousness that is in favor of change. 
									Gabuco’s installations, for example, reached a wider audience through 
									platforms like Instagram, with viewers commenting on a newfound 
									awareness towards the effects of Duterte’s campaign. However, the 
									nature of social media can make it difficult for meaningful critiques to be 
									recognized, especially when it reaches the wider public, and the art’s 
									message may be diminished or even subverted. An example of this would 
									be Kevin Raymundo’s Tumindig, a viral artwork depicting rows of kneeling 
									fists except for one, raised in objection. The artwork was appropriated by 
									Duterte supporters, superimposing a likeness of Sara Duterte “stomping 
									out” the various figures. This only demonstrates that social media can 
									both empower and potentially neutralize the capability of such art.

													<h3>Art to Influence Change</h3>

												<p> 
													Despite this, artists still have massive influence especially in the social 
													media space. The Commission on Human Rights has turned to working 
													with artists to promote human rights issues such as the extrajudicial 
													killings. Angie Umbac, the commission’s advocacy officer, has stated that 
													artists and their work are more effective than conventional means such as 
													discussions and campaigns, in terms of getting the message out to the 
													public. However, the challenge remains to use those reactions and 
													awareness into a more lasting change in the public opinion, which was 
													stated as heavily in favor of the campaign.

								<blockquote>“They have a reach bigger than the human rights community. They’re able to go into areas where we are not present. The approach is accessible to the public, noting that people are better able to empathise with artists and their work. It becomes very real to them.”</blockquote>

										<h2>Relating back to Art in Society</h2>
									  </header>
											<p>
												It has always been the role of art in society to reflect experiences and 
												serve as an expression of ideas and beliefs. Even now when systemic 
												injustices and political and social issues persist, art can initiate 
												meaningful dialogue through works that resonate deeply with people, 
												instilling thoughts and emotions that hopefully can be a potential for 
												change. While social media has its limitations, it plays an important role 
												nowadays in allowing a wider discussion and engagement of issues 
												conveyed by protest artworks. Overall, art plays a greater role in society, 
												becoming a tool for raising awareness against the social and political 
												injustices in our country.
